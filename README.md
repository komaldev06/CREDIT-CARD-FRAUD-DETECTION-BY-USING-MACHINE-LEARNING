# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-BY-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
MBA MINOR RESEARCH PROJECT
**#OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT**
The objective of this project is to analyze the patterns and trends of credit card fraud in the Indian banking sector over a ten-year period (2005-2014). The study aims to identify the factors contributing to the observed decline in online fraud incidents, evaluate the effectiveness of the security measures and strategies implemented by banks, and propose actionable guidelines that can further mitigate the risks associated with online transactions. Through this analysis, the project seeks to provide valuable insights that can help banks and financial institutions enhance their fraud detection and prevention mechanisms, thereby safeguarding their online clientele.
**SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT**
This project analyzes credit card fraud trends in the Indian banking sector over a decade, from 2005 to 2014. By examining secondary data at the bank, group, and yearly levels, the study uncovers a noticeable decline in online fraud incidents in recent years. This decline is attributed to banks' increased focus on security, better detection of emerging fraud techniques, and the implementation of effective countermeasures. The study not only highlights these trends but also proposes guidelines and strategies that banks can adopt to enhance online security. By offering insights into innovative security measures, the research contributes to reducing the risks associated with online transactions, benefiting the broader banking industry.
**METHODOLOGY OF THIS PROJECT**
The methodology of this project involves a comprehensive analysis of secondary data collected from the Indian banking sector over a ten-year period, from 2005 to 2014. The approach is structured as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Secondary data was gathered from reliable sources such as bank reports, financial institution publications, government databases, and industry studies. The data includes information on credit card transactions, reported fraud cases, security measures implemented by banks, and other relevant metrics.

2. **Data Segmentation**: 
   - The collected data was segmented at three levels: 
     - **Bank Level**: Analysis of individual banks to identify specific trends and patterns of fraud.
     - **Group Level**: Aggregation of data to assess trends across different groups of banks (e.g., public sector banks, private sector banks, foreign banks).
     - **Yearly Level**: Examination of annual trends to identify changes in the frequency and nature of fraud incidents over time.

3. **Trend Analysis**: 
   - The data was analyzed to identify patterns and trends in credit card fraud occurrences, with a focus on changes in the frequency, methods, and impact of fraud over the ten-year period.
   - Statistical tools and techniques were employed to quantify the trends and determine the significance of observed changes.

4. **Evaluation of Security Measures**: 
   - The study assessed the security measures and strategies implemented by banks during the study period, such as advancements in fraud detection technologies, customer education initiatives, and regulatory changes.
   - A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these measures in reducing fraud incidents.

5. **Development of Guidelines**: 
   - Based on the analysis, the study proposed a set of guidelines and best practices that banks can adopt to enhance their online transaction security.
   - These guidelines were formulated by identifying successful strategies employed by banks with lower fraud rates and exploring innovative security approaches.

6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: 
   - The findings were synthesized to provide actionable insights and recommendations for the banking industry.
   - The study concluded with suggestions for further research and areas where additional improvements in fraud prevention could be made.

By following this methodology, the project aims to provide a thorough understanding of credit card fraud trends in India and offer practical solutions to mitigate the associated risks.
